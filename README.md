## Synopsis

National Climate Monitoring Products are simple summaries of the weather and climate conditions in a particular country. The WMO comission for climatology Expert Team on National Climate Monitoring Products has defined a small set of standard NCMPs and has written code to calculate them.

## Code Example

Please read the documentation (R_NCMPs_User_Manual.docx)

## Motivation

Currently, a wide variety of climate monitoring products are produced around the world and there are many inconsistencies between the methods used by different countries. The inconsistencies make comparisons difficult, or impossible. 

Even simple differences such as the choice of a baseline for meauring climatic hchanges, or the length of available records can make it difficult to interpret differences from one country to the next. For example, the "warmest year on record" is newsworthy if the record is 200 years long, but less so if only 5 years of data are available.

The main aim of the task team was to generate a short list of standard national climate monitoring products that can be produced consistently by most countries. The requirement to be inclusive, to allow more countries to participate, places certain practical constraints on what can be recommended.

The team has defined how those products would be created so that comparing a national monitoring product from one country with that of another would be an "apples with apples" comparison.

The list allows countries with few resources to focus their efforts on those products which would be widely used and enable them to participate in global monitoring activities such as the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society's State of the Climate reports.

The software in this repository is a specific implementation of the general guidance produced by the team.

## Contributors

The code was originally developed by Lucie Vincent and Megan Hartwell from the Climate Research Division of Environment and Climate Change Canada. The ET-NCMP would like to thank Simon Grainger and James Adams for their important contributions to the development and testing of the computer routines.
